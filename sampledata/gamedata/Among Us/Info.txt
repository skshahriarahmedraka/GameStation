        'A clever take on the "whodunnit" genre while a tapping into what makes meme culture so relevant and universal',
      IGN: 'Among Us gives a genuinely necessary respite from reality without paying attention to itself as well.',
      'Game Informer':
        "Accessible enough for everybody, Among Us coaxes out everyone's inner psychopath and Sherlock. With short addictive bursts of gameplay that's long enough to satiate, this sleeper hit has/will become a staple in your games library and gaming nights to come."
