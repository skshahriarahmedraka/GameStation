        'With the most exciting unit roster yet, Creative Assembly's latest is a godly blend of franchises.',
      IGN: 'Deep hero progression and a well-executed Chaos invasion round out a campaign that, while it has some flaws in set-up and pacing, fulfilled all of my deepest fantasies of seeing giant, impossible armies clashing amidst the shrieking of griffins and the glow of flaming meteors summoned from the sky. It's just a damn good time.',
      'Game Informer':
        "If you find real history a bit bland compared to glorious nonsense made up by strange British people then Warhammer is the Total War for you."
