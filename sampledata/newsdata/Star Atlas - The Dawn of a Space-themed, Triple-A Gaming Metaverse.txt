A New Frontier in The Gaming Industry: Ownership of In-game structures
Greetings, Explorers!
From day one, gaming has pushed the boundaries of innovation, entertainment, and imagination. This journey, which started with only a few pixels on a screen and has since flowered into complex and beautiful open worlds, now begins a new chapter. 
Powered by state-of-the-art technology structure and Unreal Engine 5 graphics, Star Atlas is the first triple-A space exploration metaverse where players are the owners of game assets like resources, ships and crew members, and even entire planets, allowing them to use them as they see fit, trade goods and services. 
With the launch of our pre-alpha version of the Showroom, players from all over the world will be able to see their ships in cinematic quality powered by the most incredible graphics engine in the industry.
Welcome to the Pre-Alpha version of the Showroom, where the future of the metaverse has already begun.
