Season 1 has come to an end, closing the first chapter of The Cycle: Frontier. But the adventure is still only just beginning, as Season 2 is starting in full force along with a lot of new content!
Tharis Island has been recently discovered and is now ready for exploration. Players who have progressed enough through the faction campaigns will be granted access to the new map, where they can discover dark secrets, hidden in the island’s very depths. 
But that’s not all Season 2 brings to the table: Prospectors across the world can expect new missions, additional activities, cutting-edge equipment and another way to increase their firepower with the introduction of weapon perks.

Moreover, Season 2 starts with a full progress wipe, cleaning the slate for everyone looking for a fresh start. This is the perfect opportunity for new players to try their hand at that Prospecting business!
For those playing for keeps, a new Fortuna Pass is also making its appearance, with 100 levels full of goodies and new cosmetics – remember that those are not affected by the progress wipe!
Last but not least, Prime Time is making her appearance in the game, along with a selection of dazzling outfits and other cosmetics. On that note, welcome packs are currently on sale, so make sure to check out our add-ons if any of this is in your interests!
