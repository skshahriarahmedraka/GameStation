This the season to gather around the campfire and stay to hear the chilling tales of the Headless Ones ðŸŽƒ 
This year, jump into Destiny 2â€™s Festival of the Lost Event, fight through the horrors of the Haunted Lost Sectors (including a brand-new Haunted Lost Sector) and take down the Headless Ones for tons of loot!
Of course it wouldnâ€™t be Halloween without some candy, right? Jump into activities, such as Strikes, Crucible, Gambit and more to receive bundles of Candy. With it you can exchange it for Mystery Bags which contain Legendary rewards, including the new Mechabre Sniper Rifle! Donâ€™t worry, previous Festival weapons will be available as well.
Oh and thatâ€™s not all. Earlier this year the community voted for which ornaments they wanted to see made into reality for this years Festival and the winner was #TeamMech! Head on over to the Eververse in-game store and check them out.
This year's Festival of the Lost also comes with its own Event Card. Complete activities and claim event specific Triumphs to unlock cosmetic rewards and also claim the new coveted Ghost Writer Seal. Players can also update their Event Card to unlock additional cosmetic rewards, including a Legendary emote, ship transmat effect, Ghost projection and an Exotic Ghost.
Thatâ€™s enough talk, Guardians. Get into those Haunted Lost Sectors, get a bunch of candy and get that loot!
