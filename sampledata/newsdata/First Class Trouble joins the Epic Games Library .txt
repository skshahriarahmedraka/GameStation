First Class Trouble joins the Epic Games Library

By Versus Evil & Invisible Walls
Developer, Invisible Walls and Publisher, Versus Evil are ecstatic to announce that soon Epic Games Store customers can board the ISS Alithea and work with fellow passengers to defeat the murderous robot AI that has taken over the luxury space liner. 
 
One of the longstanding goals of Invisible Walls has been to bring this game to as many players as possible. Over the last year and a half weâ€™ve focused heavily on expanding the game through content updates, and weâ€™re now turning our focus towards expanding to more players and improving the balance of the game. Epic Games users will start their First Class Trouble journey with all of the updates added to the game since its release in November of 2021.
Collaboration is key on the ISS Alithea. Passengers can utilize built-in proximity-based voice chat to elevate the social dynamics of actual conversations. As friends walk away from the group to scheme and plot where no one can hear them, they must also be careful of being attacked out of earshot, as no one will hear them cry for help.

Residents must use teamwork to accomplish different co-operative tasks to navigate the different maps while the Personoids lie, disrupt, and deceive their way through the ship to kill off the Residents. 
Players can die in a variety of ways, including being dumped out of airlocks, drowned in spa pools, electrocuted, pushed into a burning fire or freezing to death in the giant walk-in freezers.


 We canâ€™t wait for Epic Games players to step onto the ISS Alithea! Weâ€™ll see you aboard ðŸš€
