Two years after its arrival on PlayStation 5, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered arrived on PC, with acclaim from critics and fans alike.

That’s in large part thanks to the work of Dutch video game developer Nixxes Software, a studio that’s made a name for itself specializing in bringing massively successful, and visually delightful console games to the computer – often with the sorts of bells and whistles that delight PC players.

Last year, the studio was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment and Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered was Nixxes’ first project following the acquisition.

Following the release of the game to Epic Games Store and Steam, we caught up with Nixxes’  Founder and Senior Director of Development Jurjen Katsman and Insomniac Games’ Core Technology Director, Mike Fitzgerald, to discuss the challenges the teams faced bringing the game to PC including delivering new controls, custom upscaling, and – of course – support for a wide range of computer specs.



 Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered to PC is on sale from Oct. 25 to Oct. 31 in the Epic Games Store.
