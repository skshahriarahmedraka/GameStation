It's time to Make Mayhem Your Business! An extraordinary cinematic adventure awaits in New Tales from the Borderlands, out now on the Epic Games Store.
On the war-torn planet of Promethea, three ordinary citizens embark on a journey that will change their lives—and possibly the entire universe—forever. Anu, Octavio, and Fran will try to turn the tables on greedy corporations, survive a planetary invasion, and even risk life and limb in the face of a vicious Vault monster!
Along the way, you'll meet a friendly assassination bot, square off against a talking gun, wield the power of a revolutionary new invention, and more!
The decisions you make determine how the story unfolds—often in unexpected ways. Whether it's Anu's vision of a universe that markets more than weapons, Octavio's dreams of fame and fortune, or Fran's frosty plot for revenge, their success or failure depends on your choices.



 We hope you enjoy experiencing this thrilling story and wish you good luck taking down Tediore's ruthless CEO Susan Coldwell.
