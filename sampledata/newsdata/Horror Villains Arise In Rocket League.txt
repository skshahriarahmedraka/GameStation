Rocket League is going all out on scares this year! As iconic horror villains prowl the Arena grounds, players will have a chance to steal away their sinister rewards.

Dare the hallowed grounds of Farmstead (Spooky) Arena while playing two ghostly Game Modes: Spooky Cube and Heatseeker. Fill your candy bag with Golden Pumpkins and Haunted Hallows Challenge Rewards, or seek out scream-filled Horror Villain Player Anthems in the Item Shop.

Haunted Hallows will run until November 1. Join us if you dare…
 
Ghoulish Gifts! 

We all love a good hero, but the true rulers of All Hallows Eve will always be the villains. This season, players who defeat the Haunted Hallows Challenges will be rewarded with Items inspired by baddies of Halloween past.  

Let the games begin! The Billy The Puppet Decal and Jigsaw Blade Wheels are the perfect tools for slicing your way to victory.

Forget about being human; when you’ve got the Chucky Doll Decal, you can take your chances as a notorious doll. Or maybe you prefer to fully embrace your humanity instead? Well, Leatherface’s Mask Decal is completely loaded with humans from head to toe. 

Hope you still have room in your candy bag. Throughout Haunted Hallows, players can earn Golden Pumpkins to unlock Items from the Velocity, Triumph, and Auriga Item Series’. You’ll also be able to pick up the free “Sole Survivor” Player Title in the Item Shop!


Modes of Madness!
